        <Text style={styles.H2}>8. PREMIUM SERVICE FEES</Text>
        <Text>
            Subscription Fees. If the Premium Service is available to you, the fees for the Premium Service will be set out on our Site or in our App (“Subscription Fees”). The Subscription Fees may vary according to the country at which the Premium Service is directed, and whether you subscribe to the Premium Service via our Site or our App. If subscribing through our App, the Subscription Fees may also vary according to whether you use the iOS or Android platform. The Subscription Fees for the Premium Service are payable as follows:

Premium Service Subscribed to via Our Site: Subscription Fees. If you subscribe to the Premium Service via our Site, Subscription Fees are payable on a pre-paid basis for a fixed duration. Once the fixed duration has come to an end, your subscription will terminate unless you enter into a further fixed term subscription.

Premium Service Subscribed to via Our App: Subscription Fees. If you subscribe to the Premium Service from our App, Subscription Fees are payable on a monthly basis and your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each month and the applicable Subscription Fees shall be due unless your subscription is cancelled in accordance with Section 9.

Payment. At the time of subscribing to the Premium Service, you will be asked to pay the Subscription Fee by a payment method as may be designated by us or our payment processor time to time. The payment method may vary depending on your location and whether you subscribe to the Premium Service via our Site or App.

Payment for Premium Service Subscribed to via Our App. You can subscribe to the Premium Service from our App (Android / iOS). By providing payment processor authorised by Google Inc. or Apple Inc. (“Authorised Payment Processor”) with the details of a payment method, you (i) promise that you are authorised to use the payment method that you provided; (ii) promise that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; and (iii) authorise the Authorised Payment Processor to take payment of the Subscription Fees on a recurring monthly basis until your subscription to the Premium Service is cancelled by you as described in Section 9, or is terminated by us in accordance with these Terms of Service. You must keep the details for your chosen payment method up to date, and ensure there are enough funds to cover the cost of the Subscription Fees. To change your payment information, please refer to the following pages: Android / iOS. If you submit updated information regarding your payment method, you agree to permit the Authorised Payment Processor to use the updated information to collect payment from you. Changes made to your payment information will not apply to Subscription Fees that were already submitted for payment.

Third-Party Charges. We or our payment processor are not responsible for any charges or fees imposed by your bank, credit or debit card issuer, or other account provider on payment of the Subscription Fees or any costs that may be incurred as a result of failed attempts to take such payment. We or our payment processor may re-attempt to take payment at any time. If we cannot take successful payment we may terminate or suspend your use of the Premium Service, however you will still owe us Subscription Fees up until the point of termination or suspension and (in the case of suspension) for the period during which your account is suspended, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. We or our payment processor may contact you if your bank, card issuer or other account provider declines payment of the Subscription Fees or refuses to authorise a recurring payment for the Subscription Fees.

Changes to the Fees. We may increase or decrease the Subscription Fees at any time in our sole discretion (including the introduction of charges for aspects of the Premium Service that were previously provided at no extra cost) and in that case, we will notify you reasonably in advance the price change takes effect, such as by sending you email or by a message displayed through the Cookpad Service. If you do not agree to the changed Subscription Fees, you may cancel your subscription to the Premium Service within thirty (30) days after we notify you of the change. If you do not cancel your subscription, then you will be deemed to have accepted the change and we will start charging the amended Subscription Fee.
